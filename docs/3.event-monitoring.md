# Event Monitoring

The AntelopeJS Stripe module provides functions for monitoring changes to payment intents, allowing your application to react to payment status updates.

## Core Monitoring Functions

### WatchAllPayments

Registers a callback to be called whenever any payment intent changes.

```typescript
import { WatchAllPayments } from '@ajs/stripe/dev';

// Usage example
WatchAllPayments((payloadId, intent, context) => {
  console.log(`Payment ${payloadId} status changed to: ${intent.status}`);
  console.log(`Change came from ${context.local ? 'local webhook' : 'external source'}`);

  if (intent.status === 'succeeded') {
    // Handle successful payment
    completeOrder(payloadId);
  } else if (intent.status === 'canceled') {
    // Handle canceled payment
    cancelOrder(payloadId);
  }
}, true); // Only listen to local events (webhook-triggered)
```

#### Parameters

- `callback` (IntentWatcher): Function to call when a payment intent changes
- `onlyLocal` (optional boolean): If true, only triggers for events from local webhooks

#### Callback Function

The callback function receives:

- `id` (any): The custom identifier that was associated with the payment intent (from metadata.payload)
- `intent` (Stripe.PaymentIntent): The full payment intent object
- `context` (IntentChangeContext): Contains information about the event source

### WatchPayment

Registers a callback to be called when a specific payment intent changes.

```typescript
import { WatchPayment } from '@ajs/stripe/dev';

// Usage example
WatchPayment('pi_1234567890', (payloadId, intent, context) => {
  console.log(`Payment ${payloadId} status changed to: ${intent.status}`);

  if (intent.status === 'succeeded') {
    // Handle successful payment
    updateOrderStatus(payloadId, 'paid');
  }
});
```

#### Parameters

- `paymentIntentId` (string): The Stripe ID of the payment intent to watch
- `callback` (IntentWatcher): Function to call when the payment intent changes

#### Callback Function

The callback receives the same parameters as in WatchAllPayments.

## IntentChangeContext Interface

The context object passed to watchers provides information about the event:

```typescript
interface IntentChangeContext {
  local: boolean; // Whether the event was triggered by a local webhook
}
```

## IntentWatcher Type

The callback function type for payment watching:

```typescript
type IntentWatcher = (
  id: any, // The custom payload ID associated with the payment
  intent: Stripe.PaymentIntent, // The full payment intent object
  context: IntentChangeContext, // Information about the event source
) => void;
```

## Combining with Payment Processing

Watching for payment changes can be combined with other payment functions:

```typescript
import { InitializePayment, WatchPayment } from '@ajs/stripe/dev';

// Example of creating a payment and watching for its completion
async function processAndMonitorPayment(orderId: string, amount: number) {
  // Create the payment intent
  const intent = await InitializePayment(orderId, {
    amount,
    currency: 'usd',
    payment_method_types: ['card'],
  });

  // Set up a watcher for this specific payment
  WatchPayment(intent.id, (payloadId, updatedIntent, context) => {
    if (updatedIntent.status === 'succeeded') {
      console.log(`Order ${payloadId} has been paid successfully!`);
      // Update order status in database, send confirmation email, etc.
    } else if (updatedIntent.status === 'canceled') {
      console.log(`Payment for order ${payloadId} was canceled`);
      // Update order status, notify customer, etc.
    }
  });

  return intent;
}
```
